Hi there, I'm [Eudes Adiba!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eudes-adiba/) a Ph.D. researcher building tools that enhance the accessibility and usefulness of Open Data. With a background in statistics, I’m deepening my expertise in data science to strengthen the analytical foundation of the projects I’m involved in.

🌱 **Research Interests**: My research focuses on building artefacts that tackle three key and interconnected limitations of Open Data: *Quality*, *Findability*, and *Understandability*. Throughout my work, I combine mixed methods and Machine Learning, with a strong commitment to reproducible research.

⚡ **My Repos**: A mix of projects from my curious dives into different topics, methods, and tools, all part of my ongoing learning adventures! Welcome to my playground 😄


🌐 **I am open to**:
- Collaboration opportunities (anytime & anywhere & any type) and 
- Research stays

💬 **A quote that describes me**:  
“Can I say something? Um, I’m the type of person that if you ask me a question and I don’t know the answer, I’m gonna tell you that I don’t know. But I bet you what, I know how to find the answer and I will find the answer.” Chris Gardner interpreted by Will Smith in the movie "Pursuit of Happyness" (2006)
