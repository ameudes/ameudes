# Hi there, I'm Eudes! 
I'm a Ph.D. Researcher, building tools that enhance the accessibility and usefulness of Open Data. With a background in statistics, I’m deepening my expertise in data science to strengthen the analytical foundation of the projects I’m involved in. 

Here you will find a mix of projects from my curious dives into different topics, methods, and tools, all part of my ongoing learning adventures! Welcome to my playground 😄

## 🌱 Research Interests
My research focuses on building artefacts that tackle three key and interconnected limitations of Open Data: **Quality**, **Findability**, and **Understandability**. Throughout my work, I combine mixed methods and Machine Learning, with a strong commitment to reproducible research. **I am open to collaboration opportunities**.

## 💬 A quote that describes me 
“Can I say something? Um, I’m the type of person that if you ask me a question and I don’t know the answer, I’m gonna tell you that I don’t know. But I bet you what, I know how to find the answer and I will find the answer.” Chris Gardner interpreted by Will Smith in the movie "Pursuit of Happyness" (2006)
